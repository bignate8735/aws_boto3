# This project will teach the fundamentals of working with aws services using the aws CLI and python

## Create and Activate Virtual Environment
- python -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate

#### Install boto3
- pip install boto3

#### Install boto3 with crt 

Note: In addition to boto3 default install, we can choose to incliude the new AWS common
Runtime (CRT). the crt is a collection of modular packages that serve as a new foundation
for AWS SDK'S. USING THE CRT, SDK"S can share the same base code when possible, improving
consistency throughput optimization across AWS SDK'S

#### To use the CRT + Boto3, install boto3 like below:
- pip install boto3[crt]

#### To revert to thr thr non crt version of boto3
- pip uninstall awscrt

#### To enable CRT again
- pip install boto3[crt]

#### Save dependencies in requirements.txt
- pip freeze > requirements.txt         

#### Save depencies in requirements.txt
- pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Setting up boto3 to accesss AWS resources/ services
- install CLI from here https://aws.amzon.com/cli
- After create IAM crednetials and run:
- aws configure

#### Passing credentials as parameters
- There are two ways to pass credentials dynamically in the code as credentials 
- 1. while creating boto3 client(client() method)
- 2. while creating boto3 session () method)
exampel:

1. client = boto3.client(
"s3"
aws_acess_key_id = ACCESS_KEY,
aws_secret_key_id = SECRET_KEY,
aws_session_token = SESSION_TOKEN
)

2.  session = boto3.Session(
aws_acess_key_id = ACCESS_KEY,
aws_secret_key_id = SECRET_KEY,
aws_session_token = SESSION_TOKEN
)
Note: Session_Token is needed when using temporary credentials


| Feature              | **Session** (e.g., `boto3.Session()`)                             | **Client** (e.g., `boto3.client()`)                            | **Resource** (e.g., `boto3.resource()`)                    |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Abstraction Level** | High-level, manages configuration and credentials.                | Low-level, closer to raw API calls.                          | High-level, object-oriented abstraction over AWS services. |
| **Ease of Use**       | Used to configure AWS SDK settings (e.g., region, credentials).   | More verbose; requires more boilerplate code.                | Easier and more Pythonic; works like normal Python objects. |
| **Operations**        | Provides context and configuration for creating clients/resources.| Provides direct access to AWS service operations (API calls).| Simplifies working with resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc. |
| **Customization**     | Controls the region, profile, and credentials for AWS interactions. | Full control, allows fine-grained configuration.             | Less control, but much simpler for common tasks.            |
| **Examples**          | Managing session configurations like AWS credentials and region.| Starting EC2 instances, managing IAM roles.                 | Managing S3 buckets, EC2 instance state, DynamoDB tables.   |

## Note that by default if a session is not created and a client or resource object is created automatically a session is created.
